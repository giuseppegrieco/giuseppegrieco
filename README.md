## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Giuseppe Grieco and I am a computer science enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems using cutting-edge technologies. I am particularly interested in algorithms, DevOps, machine learning, competitive programming, and backend development. 

In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and participating in online coding challenges [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/giuseppegrieco). 

If you have any questions or just want to chat about computer science, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/griecogiuseppe/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_giuseppegrieco). I'd love to connect!
